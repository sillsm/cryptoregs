## CFTC Backgrounder on Self-Certified Contracts for Bitcoin Products
On Friday, December 1, 2017, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME) and the CBOE Futures Exchange (CFE) selfcertified new contracts for bitcoin futures products and the Cantor Exchange self-certified a new contract for bitcoin binary
options. The following fact sheet outlines the self-certification process of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC), as well as the CFTC’s role in oversight of virtual currencies.
Self-Certification Background
Prior to listing new contracts, the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) provides designated contract markets (DCMs) with the
option to either:
 submit a written self-certification to the CFTC that the contract complies with the CEA and CFTC regulations, or
 voluntarily submit the contract for Commission approval.
When a DCM self-certifies a new contract it must determine that the offering complies with the CEA and Commission
regulations, including that the new contract is not readily susceptible to manipulation. This is the same standard the
Commission uses when reviewing products for approval. A complete list of the DCM core principles is included at the end
of this document. DCMs must provide an explanation and analysis to this effect. Unless the Commission finds that a new
product would violate the CEA or Commission regulations, the DCM may list the new product no sooner than one full
business day following the self-certification.
 As a matter of practice, exchanges bring the vast majority of new products to market through this self-certification
process. Even though this process provides for a one-business-day listing period, CME, CFE and Cantor
provided Commission staff with advanced draft contract terms and conditions for their bitcoin contracts.
Commission staff reviewed this information, engaged in many discussions with the DCMs and the derivatives
clearing organizations (DCOs) that will be clearing the contracts for CME and CFE, and evaluated whether any
aspects of the contracts raise questions regarding compliance with the CEA and Commission regulations.
 Staff has assessed potential risk of defaults in these futures contracts on the DCOs. Based on analysis of
different stress scenarios, staff estimates that any potential impact will not be significant to a DCO. CFTC staff will
continue to monitor potential risk factors closely and work with the DCOs to ensure that the health of the clearing
system is maintained.
 Given the current statutory and regulatory framework, the Commission has limited ability to require the DCMs to
make changes to their contracts or to require the DCOs to change their approaches to clearing the contracts. For
example, the Commission does not have the authority to require the DCOs to establish separate clearing systems
or guaranty funds to clear these contracts. Those decisions are left to individual DCOs acting through established
risk governance mechanisms and in compliance with the CEA and Commission regulations. But based on
feedback received from a number of market participants, Commission staff did not find widespread support for
these contracts to be cleared in a separate guaranty fund.
 CME, in its capacity as a DCO, plans to clear its own contracts, while CFE plans to clear its contracts at another
DCO, the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). Both DCOs provided Commission staff with information about
how they intend to manage risks associated with bitcoin futures. Commission staff reviewed this information,
including examining how the DCOs will satisfy their obligation to establish initial margin requirements that are
commensurate with the risks of the contracts. Cantor plans to clear its contracts at Cantor Clearinghouse. Unlike
the CME and CBOE, Cantor’s contracts will be fully margined and thus do not raise the same type of risk issues. 
CFTC Background
 The CFTC was established as an independent agency in 1974 by the CEA, assuming responsibilities that had
previously belonged to the Department of Agriculture since the 1920s, namely, protecting against fraud,
manipulation, and abusive practices related to the commodity futures markets. These markets have existed since
the 1860s, beginning with agricultural commodities such as wheat, corn, and cotton.
 Ensuring that CFTC-regulated markets are resilient and reliable allows for market risk to be appropriately
managed by American businesses, resulting in stable pricing for everything from groceries to energy services and
home mortgage rates.
 The mission of the CFTC is to foster open, transparent, competitive, and financially sound markets. By working to
avoid systemic risk, the Commission aims to protect market users and their funds, consumers, and the public
from fraud, manipulation, and abusive practices related to derivatives and other products that are subject to the
CEA.
 To foster the public interest and fulfill its mission, the CFTC will act:
o To deter and prevent price manipulation or any other disruptions to market integrity;
o To ensure the financial integrity of all transactions subject to the CEA and the avoidance of systemic risk;
o To protect all market participants from fraudulent or other abusive sales practices and misuse of customer
assets; and
o To promote responsible innovation and fair competition among boards of trade, other markets, and
market participants.
 The CFTC believes responsible innovation is market-enhancing.
Virtual Currency Background
Although precise definitions on virtual currency offered by others are varied, an IRS definition provides us with a general
idea:
 “Virtual currency is a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account,
and/or a store of value.
 In some environments, it operates like ‘real’ currency . . . but it does not have legal tender status [in the U.S.].
 Virtual currency that has an equivalent value in real currency, or that acts as a substitute for real currency, is
referred to as ‘convertible’ virtual currency. Bitcoin is one example of a convertible virtual currency.
 Bitcoin can be digitally traded between users and can be purchased for, or exchanged into, U.S. dollars, Euros,
and other real or virtual currencies.”
The definition of “commodity” in the CEA is broad.
 It can mean a physical commodity, such as an agricultural product (e.g., wheat, cotton) or natural resource (e.g.,
gold, oil).
 It can mean a currency or interest rate.
 The CEA definition of “commodity” also includes “all services, rights, and interests . . . in which contracts for future
delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.”
The CFTC first found that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are properly defined as commodities in 2015.
 The CFTC has oversight over futures, options, and swaps.
 The CFTC’s jurisdiction is implicated when a virtual currency is used in a derivatives contract, or if there is fraud
or manipulation involving a virtual currency traded in interstate commerce.
Beyond instances of fraud or manipulation, the CFTC generally does not oversee “spot” or cash market exchanges and
transactions involving virtual currencies that do not utilize margin, leverage, or financing.

LabCFTC, the Commission’s FinTech initiative, in October 2017.
Futures Background
A commodity futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a particular commodity at a future date. The price and the
amount of the commodity are fixed at the time of the agreement. Some contracts contemplate that the agreement will be
fulfilled by actual delivery of the commodity at a future date, while other contracts allow cash settlement in lieu of delivery.
Most contracts are liquidated before the delivery date. A commodity futures option gives the purchaser the right to buy or 
sell a particular futures contract at a future date for a particular price. With limited exceptions, commodity futures and
options must be traded through an exchange by persons and firms who are registered with the CFTC.
Many participants in the futures markets are commercial or institutional commodities producers or consumers. These
participants trade futures to maximize the value of their assets, and to reduce the risk of financial losses from price
changes. Other participants in the futures markets are speculators or liquidity providers who provide necessary liquidity to
the futures markets so commercial participants can hedge their risks.
Companies and individuals who handle customer funds or give trading advice must register with the National Futures
Association (NFA), a self-regulatory organization approved by the CFTC.
The CFTC seeks to protect customers by requiring:
 market risks and past performance to be disclosed to prospective customers;
 customer funds to be kept in accounts separate from the firm’s own funds; and
 customer accounts to be adjusted to reflect each trading day’s current market value at close
The CFTC also monitors registrant supervision systems, internal controls and sales practice compliance programs. The
NFA provides detailed information for traders.
Key CFTC Terms
Designated Contract Market (DCM) – an exchange that may list for trading futures or option contracts based on all types
of commodities and that may allow access to their facilities by all types of traders, including retail customers. Some DCMs
have been operating for many years as traditional futures exchanges, while others are new markets that were only
recently designated as contract markets by the CFTC. CFTC staff perform regular reviews of each DCM's ongoing
compliance with the required core principles called Rule Enforcement Reviews.
Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO) - an entity that enables each party to an agreement, contract, or transaction to
substitute, through novation or otherwise, the credit of the DCO for the credit of the parties; arranges or provides, on a
multilateral basis, for the settlement or netting of obligations; or otherwise provides clearing services or arrangements that
mutualize or transfer credit risk among participants. A DCO that seeks to provide clearing services with respect to futures
contracts, options on futures contracts, or swaps must register with the CFTC before it can begin providing such services.
Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) - an intermediary that solicits or accepts orders for futures or options contracts
traded on or subject to the rules of an exchange; and in or in connection with such solicitation or acceptance of orders,
accepts money, securities, or property (or extends credit in lieu thereof) to margin, guarantee, or secure any trades or
contracts that result or may result.
Introducing Broker (IB) - an intermediary that solicits or accepts orders for futures or options contracts traded on or
subject to the rules of an exchange; and does not accept any money, securities, or property (or extend credit in lieu
thereof) to margin, guarantee, or secure any trades or contracts that result or may result.
